* SlopeConditionsVitO2TMRE.Rmd: code to generate figures ESCPlotDoublingTime.pdf, FIBPlotDoublingTime.pdf and ExamplePlot. Also contains ANOVA analysis to get significance (significance in the figure was added in Keynote)
* ExamplePlot: plot that shows the decay of TMRE across days. Used to illustrate ESCPlotDoublingTime and FIBPlotDoublingTime. 
* FIBPlotDoublingTime & ESCPlotDoublingTime: shows doubling time in each experimental condition (TMRE, VitC and O2). Points are replicates and lines are replicate mean. Celltypes are ploted separately.
* DS_ESCannotations.csv & DS_FIBannotations.csv: input files to get the figures, required to run SlopeConditionsVitO2TMRE.Rmd.
