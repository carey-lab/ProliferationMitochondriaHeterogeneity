# use tximport to get counts from abundance.h5 file
# use counts as input to create .gct file for GSEA
# fib_GSEA_2016 or 2018 gene id or transcriptional id and fib_GSEA_2016 or 2018 human gene symbol are to see which way is better to get the most corresponding gene symbols
# FIB_GSEA_geneid and FIB_GSEA_genesymbol are to transfer mouse transcriptional id to mouse gene id or human gene symbol
